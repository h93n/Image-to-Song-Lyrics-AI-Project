# Image to Song Lyrics AI Project

The "Image to Song Lyrics AI Project" is a web application that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to generate personalized song lyrics from uploaded images. This creative project combines cutting-edge technologies, including image captioning, natural language generation, and audio synthesis, to provide a unique and engaging user experience.
